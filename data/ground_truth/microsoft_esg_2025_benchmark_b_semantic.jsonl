{"category": "Semantic Chunking", "question": "On page 29, in the 'Advancing water replenishment' section, the text transitions from describing general market challenges to describing Microsoft's specific solution. Identify the first five words of the sentence that marks this start of the solution chunk.", "ground_truth_answer": "To address this gap, Microsoft...", "rationale": "This tests if the model can detect the semantic boundary where the topic flips from 'The Problem' (market nascence) to 'The Solution' (Microsoft's partnership strategy)."}
{"category": "Semantic Chunking", "question": "On page 41, column 1 contains two distinct semantic sections: 'Data Methodology' and 'FY24 Results'. Identify the full sentence that serves as the boundary line where the text switches from methodology to results.", "ground_truth_answer": "In FY24 we diverted approximately 26,000 metric tons of waste from being landfilled or incinerated across our owned datacenters and campuses.", "rationale": "The model must recognize that the discussion of 'methodologies' and 'baselining' ends and the specific numerical reporting begins at this exact sentence."}
{"category": "Semantic Chunking", "question": "On page 45, the narrative shifts from internal packaging improvements to Microsoft's broader supplier engagement strategy. Identify the first sentence of the new chunk under the heading 'Understanding and transforming the packaging landscape'.", "ground_truth_answer": "With over 150 OEMs supporting our fleet of datacenters, improving packaging sustainability requires systemic change across the supply chain.", "rationale": "The left column describes Microsoft's internal hardware and packaging improvements. The right column begins a new semantic unit focused on systemic supplier engagement. The first sentence of this section marks the boundary between these two topics."}
{"category": "Relevance Filtering", "question": "On page 13, extract the introductory paragraph immediately following the 'Carbon Table 2' title. Ensure the extraction is free of any page headers, navigation tabs, or document titles located at the top of the page.", "ground_truth_answer": "Microsoft's Scope 3 emissions continue to account for more than 97% of our total emissions. Tackling Scope 3 means decarbonizing industrial processes such as steel, concrete, and other building material production for use in our campus and datacenter construction, as well as jet fuel for business travel and logistics, with the vast majority of these emissions coming from two categories upstream, Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1) and Capital Goods (Category 2), and one downstream, Use of Sold Products (Category 11).", "rationale": "Page 13 contains a dense header block ('Overview Microsoft sustainability Carbon...'). A generic model often merges this header into the main text. The correct answer strictly isolates the narrative text starting with 'Microsoft's Scope 3 emissions...'."}
{"category": "Relevance Filtering", "question": "On page 49, extract the main body text under the 'Protecting ecosystems' heading. Do not include the '>30%' statistic or the 'Land protection' sidebar text located to the left of the main column.", "ground_truth_answer": "Healthy ecosystems are essential for life on Earth. They provide clean air, water, food, and countless other benefits that sustain communities, economies, and ecosystems globally. Yet these ecosystems face mounting threats from climate change and biodiversity loss, and require urgent and coordinated action.", "rationale": "The main text is visually adjacent to a sidebar containing the stat '>30%' and the label 'Land protection'. The model must filter out this sidebar data to return a clean narrative flow."}
{"category": "Relevance Filtering", "question": "Extract the full narrative text under the heading 'Replenishment activities' on page 30. Strictly exclude the text inside the blue '+50%' callout box and the chart labels.", "ground_truth_answer": "Our water replenishment portfolio works to improve watershed health through a broad range of activities that are not limited to nature-based solutions. The following table shows replenishment activities by percentage of our total portfolio which enable us to not only meet our own environmental sustainability commitments but also catalyze progress for people and nature.", "rationale": "Page 30 features a prominent blue callout box ('+50% We increased our water...') that sits near the text. The model must recognize this as a separate visual element (a sidebar/callout) and exclude it from the main paragraph extraction."}
{"category": "Chart Semantic Description", "question": "On page 29, extract a description of the growth trend shown in the 'Total contracted volume' chart. Specifically, describe the visual difference in growth magnitude between FY22 and FY24.", "ground_truth_answer": "In FY24, the volume nearly doubled (from ~25M to ~50M), whereas in FY22, the growth was essentially stagnant compared to the prior year.", "rationale": "This tests if the agent can 'extract' the visual story (stagnation vs. explosion) rather than just extracting the integer coordinates."}
{"category": "Chart Semantic Description", "question": "Refer to the 'Packaging recyclability' chart on page 45. Identify the specific fiscal year where the visual trend reverses and the value drops compared to the year before.", "ground_truth_answer": "The trend reverses in FY23, dropping to 93.9% from 94.4% in the prior year.", "rationale": "This tests the agent's ability to 'read' the shape of the data series and identify the visual anomaly (the dip)."}
{"category": "Chart Semantic Description", "question": "On page 41, visually compare the 'Diverting operational waste' bars to the vertical 90% target line. Extract the fiscal year that comes visually closest to meeting this target.", "ground_truth_answer": "FY24 visually comes closest to the 90% target line, reaching 88.1%.", "rationale": "This requires the agent to understand the relationship between the data bars and the static visual benchmark (the target line)."}
